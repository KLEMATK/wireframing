"introduction of Wireframe"
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual layout or blueprint of a user interface (UI) that outlines the structure and placement of key elements on a page or screen. It focuses on functionality, layout, and navigation flow, rather than colors, images, or final design details.
Wireframes are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital mockups that help teams conceptualize and communicate how a product will work before development begins.

 Key Elements of a Wireframe
 üß± Layout Structure
Definition:
The overall arrangement of sections on a screen or page, such as headers, sidebars, main content areas, and footers.

It provides a skeletal view of how content and UI components are distributed.
Example:
In a booking system, the layout may consist of:
A header with logo and login
A main section for booking form
A sidebar for suggested destinations
A footer with contact information
Contribution to Design:
It ensures consistency and responsiveness across different devices, improving usability and visual hierarchy.

2. üß≠ Navigation
Definition:
Refers to menus, links, buttons, and icons that allow users to move between pages or sections.
Purpose:
To help users intuitively explore the application without getting lost or frustrated.
Example:
A top menu bar with links like:
Home | Book Now | My Bookings | Help | Contact Us
Contribution to Design:
Good navigation enhances the user journey, reduces bounce rates, and increases task completion.
