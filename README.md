"introduction of Wireframe"
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual layout or blueprint of a user interface (UI) that outlines the structure and placement of key elements on a page or screen. It focuses on functionality, layout, and navigation flow, rather than colors, images, or final design details.
Wireframes are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital mockups that help teams conceptualize and communicate how a product will work before development begins.

Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
• Clarifies Structure and Flow
• Saves Time and Resources
• Improves Collaboration
• Supports Better User Experience (UX)
